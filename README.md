# nuuxCE.github.io
A simple page that stores data offline and exchange currencies. 
No JS Library/Framework has been used. No css framework. 

I had some issues with indexedDB which I solved by using redundant code. I know it's not good practice but as a work around for this tight deadline.

This is the github page https://nuux14.github.io/nuuxCE.github.io/
